Prototype Object
----------------
All objects have a prototype property. It is a reference to another object called *proto*.

When a method is invoked on an object, the method can be defined at any point in the *prototype chain*.

Different objects can share the same  *prototype chain*.

The base object is the very bottom of the prototype chain.

See for example what the prototype object is for a base object, an array and a function.
